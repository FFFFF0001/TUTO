		<p >Since currently there are many students want a personal or public instructor to instruct them on some specific fields, such as IELTS, GRE, CPA and so on (just see the first floor of BA). Our goal is to build a website that let those who want to instruct or to be instructed, find each other in an efficient way, instead of putting posters and fliers everywhere. Users have to register, fill in their contact info, and will be divided into three groups: student, instructor and intermediary. Students will have to tell what they would like to study, what kind of instructor (Male? Female? Current student or not? How long theyâ€™ve been teaching and so on) they want, Instructors will have to fill in their fields that they good at, there grade in such fields, teaching experience and some hobbies and other detail personal information. Intermediaries are agents that offer rooms for students and instructors to have classes, offer meals and refreshments during study time and so on. </p>
